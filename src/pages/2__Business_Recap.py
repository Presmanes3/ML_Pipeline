This section provides a clear overview of the **business assumptions, conditions, and limitations** of the house price prediction model.

    The model is designed to **estimate the market price of a residential property** 
    using structural and geographic features (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, latitude/longitude, and neighborhood zones).
    
    The purpose is to support **real estate valuation, benchmarking, and decision-making** ‚Äî not to replace official appraisals.

with st.expander("üß© Business & Data Assumptions"):
    st.markdown("""
    1. Historical property prices are **representative of the current housing market**.  
    2. Input data has **sufficient quality** (e.g., no severe typos, unrealistic values).  
    3. Features used reflect **structural and geographic information only** ‚Äî no qualitative factors such as interior design, views, or noise are included.  
    4. Relationships between features and price are assumed to be **stable over time**, with no major economic shocks considered.

    The dataset is filtered based on business constraints:
    
    - **Price range**: 100,000 ‚Äì 3,000,000 USD

    - **Bathrooms (BATH)**: 1 ‚Äì 6  
    - **Square footage (SQFT)**: 100 ‚Äì 4,000  
    
    Any record outside of these thresholds is removed as an outlier.  
    This ensures the model does not learn from unrealistic or irrelevant properties.

    The following derived features are computed:
    
    - `log(PROPERTYSQFT)` ‚Üí stabilizes variance of square footage.

    - `beds_per_sqft = BEDS / SQFT`  
    - `beds_per_bath = BEDS / BATH`  
    - `baths_per_bed = BATH / BEDS`  
    - **Cluster-based zone encoding** (`KMeansClusterEncoder`) using latitude/longitude.  
    - **Median imputation** for missing values in numeric features.  
    
    These transformations improve model robustness and capture hidden patterns (e.g., density of usage per room, neighborhood clustering).
